/*
 Explanation
 -> num > 0: This part checks whether num is greater than 0.
    This is important because powers of two are always positive integers.
    If num is not greater than 0 (i.e., it's zero or negative), the function immediately returns false.

 ->(num & (num - 1)) == 0: This is the core of the logic to check if num is a power of two.
   (num - 1) subtracts 1 from num. When you subtract 1 from a binary number, 
   it flips the least significant 1 bit to 0 and all the trailing 0s to 1s.
   For example, if num is 8 (binary: 1000), (num - 1) is 7 (binary: 0111).

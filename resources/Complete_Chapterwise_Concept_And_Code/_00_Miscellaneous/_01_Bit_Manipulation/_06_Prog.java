/*
 Output
 50 is an even number

 84 is an even number

 3 is an odd number
 */

 /*
  Explanation
  any even number has its last bit as 0
  example  8  -> 1000
           24 -> 11000
   any odd number has its last nit as 1
   example  11 -> 1011
           27  -> 11011
    We just need to check that last bit is 1 or 0
    Note: This is faster than modulus(%) operation, which is (n % 2 == 0)

  HINT: XOR(^) operator
 The XOR (exclusive or) operation is a binary logical operation that takes two binary values (0 or 1)
 and returns 1 if the number of 1s among the inputs is odd, and 0 if it's even

  Explanation

  Considering the above example
  arr[] = {2,1,2,5,1,4,4,7,3,3}
  We can see if we take a XOR of all the elements we will get in the end 5 ^ 7
  because due to repetation all the repeat values get cancel out
  now 5 ^ 7 = 2, let's consider any value, but we need to note that
  2 = 0 1 0
  5 = 1 0 1
  7 = 1 1 1 
  we can see 5 and 7 binary arrangement does not match at the least set bit, which is the 1st position in this example
  if we create a mask  = 1 << (least set position)
  and run a loop in the array which elements have 1 at that bit position, then we can see
  5, whose that specific bit position was 0, will have values = 1,5,1,4,4
  7, whose that specific bit position was 1, will have values = 2,2,7,3,3
  If we run a XOR operation to this each different set, we will get 5 and 7 respectively
